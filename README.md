## 1. Introduction to Data Science
### Some Supervised Approaches
**Regression:** Learn a line/curve (the model) using training data consisting of Input-output pairs. Use it to predict the outputs for new inputs<br>
**SVM(Support Vector Machines):** Support Vector Machine (SVM) models have the ability to perform a non-linear regression / classification by mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces<br>

**Classification:** Learn to separate different classes (the model) using training data consisting of input-output pairs Use it to identify the labels for new inputs<br>
**Ensembles:** Ensemble methods are machine learning techniques that combines several models in order to produce optimal models<br>

### Training Model
• Our training data comes in pairs of inputs (x,y)<br>
• D={(x1,y1),...,(xn,yn)}<br>

xi: input vector of the ith sample (feature vector)<br>
yi: label of the ith sample Training dataset<br>
D: Training dataset

The goal of supervised learning is to develop a model h:<br>
h(xi)≈yi for all (xi,yi)∈D<br>

### Train, Test, Validation
Sample proportion of non-relapse when treated with lithium: 6/24<br>
Sample proportion of non-relapse when treated with placebo: 4/24<br>
